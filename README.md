# Portfolio

## Description 
This is my personal portfolio that will showcase some projects that I have worked on, or are currently working on, my GitHub, Linkedin, and Stack Overflow profiles, as well as my resume.

## Usage
At the top of the header, you should see 4 options you can select. If you select "About Me", you will see a photo of myself, along with a couple of paragraphs getting to know me and my passions. When "Portfolio" is selected, it will showcase 3 of my personal projects. As of right now, I dont have 3, but I will update it as I create more! 
The "Contact" will redirect you to a page where you will be prompted to give your name, email, and message that you want me to see if you choose to contact me. The "Resume" will redirect to a page that has a clickable link that will allow the user to download my personal resume, as well as show the proficiencies that I feel confident in.
